CHANGES COMING IN .NET 2.0 SERVICE PACK
=======================================

(This is speculative, based on a reflection of the .NET 2.0 libraries that shipped
with the Visual Studio Orcas March 2007 CTP)


- HostingEnvironment.RegisterVirtualPathProvider will no longer block precompiled
  applications from using a virtual path provider.  This appears to have come down
  in the VS2005 update for Vista ... hey look, they changed .NET and didn't tell anyone.
  GREAT.  Development under Vista just became a waste of time since the behaviors
  might be different than XP.
  
- Cookies *might* be handled correctly now, but it doesn't really look that way.
  Need to do a little more investigation and testing on the CTP runtime
